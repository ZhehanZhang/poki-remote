///
/// - approval asked (always, never throttled): the screen lights even when locked;
/// - a run finishes (quiet for `finishAfter`), a problem, a pairing code, paired.
///
/// Never while the runner may be sending input: an alert expands the Dynamic Island over the top
/// of the screen, and on the owner's phone the agent's next tap (Back, a list's first row) landed
/// on the expanded island and opened Poki. So steps, the start of a run and app switches only
/// change the compact island and the Lock Screen (the event tag); they never expand it. Updates are sent one after another, in order, so an alert is never overtaken
